# nana
Nana is Hebrew for Mint. This repo contains code within which I am emulating Intuit's budgeting tool, "Mint" but for customized use-cases

# Instructions
Step 1 - Upload all csv banking files. Bank of America, Chase, and AMEX are the only supported statements.
Select all files at once.

Commit them to main.

Step 2 - Navigate to https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/8d12b6df-7b69-4e95-8300-71a3c8291922/page/BohsC

Note: This repo only works for one dashboard, so uploads will fully overwrite this dash (for now)
