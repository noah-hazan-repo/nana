# nana
Nana is Hebrew for Mint. This repo contains code within which I am emulating Intuit's budgeting tool, "Mint" but for customized use-cases

# Instructions
Step 1 - Upload all csv banking files. Bank of America, Chase, and AMEX are the only supported statements.
(This will trigger the pipeline on each upload. It fully overwrites, so continue uploading until all are submitted.)

Commit them to main.

Step 2 - Navigate to https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/8d12b6df-7b69-4e95-8300-71a3c8291922/page/BohsC

Note: This repo only works for one dashboard, so uploads will fully overwrite this dash (for now)
